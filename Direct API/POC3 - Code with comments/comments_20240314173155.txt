The given code is for a Payroll system in RPG. It has a declared file called "FTRANSACT" to store transaction records and "FEMPLOYEE" to store employee records. It has a procedure "CalcPay" to calculate the payment for the employee based on their rate, hours worked, and bonus. It starts by checking if there is a record found in the employee file for the given transaction number. If found, it calculates the payment using the CalcPay procedure and prints it on the printer file "FQSYSPRT". If not found, it prints a message saying the transaction number is not on the employee file. Finally, it prints the end of the listing message.
